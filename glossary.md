A few of bits of terminology we use at ChatID that you might not have heard of yet

### Channel

A location or place where a user can initiate a conversation with a ChatID. 

e.g. a retailer such as "newegg"


### ChatID

Your "ChatID" is a universal handle for your brand; this is shared across all of our software clients to identify you.

A ChatID has a "default" route that chats will be routed to when a route is not specified.


### Profile

Contains the data required to connect to your agent console.

This is the data that lets us connect to a department, skill, or group of agents in a live chat system.

### Route

This determines which agent or group of agents will answer an incoming chat. A Route consists of an ordered list of profile(s). Chats are directed to specific profiles depending on agent availability.

This can be seen as analogous to a phone extension.
